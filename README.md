# SocialMedia

The Social Media Project is a full-stack web application designed to mimic the core functionalities of a social networking platform. It allows users to create accounts, share posts (text, images, videos), interact with other users (like, comment, share), create and vote on polls, and send messages in real-time. The project is built using modern web development technologies and is designed to be scalable and modular.
